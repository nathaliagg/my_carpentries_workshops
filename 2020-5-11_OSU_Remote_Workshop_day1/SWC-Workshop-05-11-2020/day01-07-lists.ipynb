    "- How can I store multiple values?\n",

    "- Explain why programs need collections of values.\n",
    "- Write programs that create, index, slice, and modify lists through assignment and method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points:\n",
    "- A list stores many values in a single structure.\n",
    "- Use an item's index to fetch it from a list.\n",
    "- Lists' values can be replaced by assigning to them.\n",
    "- Appending items to a list lengthens it.\n",
    "- Use `del` to remove items from a list entirely.\n",
    "- The empty list contains no values.\n",
    "- Lists may contain values of different types.\n",
    "- Character strings can be indexed like lists.\n",
    "- Character strings are immutable.\n",
    "- Indexing beyond the end of the collection is an error.\n",
