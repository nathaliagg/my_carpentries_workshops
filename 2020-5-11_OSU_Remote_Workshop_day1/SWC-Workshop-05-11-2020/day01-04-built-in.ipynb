    "- How can I use built-in functions?\n",
    "- How can I find out what they do?\n",
    "- What kind of errors can occur in programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "- Explain the purpose of functions.\n",
    "- Correctly call built-in Python functions.\n",
    "- Correctly nest calls to built-in functions.\n",
    "- Use help to display documentation for built-in functions.\n",
    "- Correctly describe situations in which SyntaxError and NameError occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points:\n",
    "- Use comments to add documentation to programs.\n",
    "- A function may take zero or more arguments.\n",
    "- Commonly-used built-in functions include `max`, `min`, and `round`.\n",
    "- Functions may only work for certain (combinations of) arguments.\n",
    "- Functions may have default values for some arguments.\n",
    "- Use the built-in function `help` to get help for a function.\n",
    "- The Jupyter Notebook has two ways to get help.\n",
    "- Every function returns something.\n",
    "- Python reports a syntax error when it can't understand the source of a program.\n",
    "- Python reports a runtime error when something goes wrong while a program is executing.\n",
    "- Fix syntax errors by reading the source code, and runtime errors by tracing the program's execution.\n",
