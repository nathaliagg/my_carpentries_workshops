    "- How can I make a program to repeat a task?\n",

    "- Explain what for loops are normally used for.\n",
    "- Trace the execution of a simple (unnested) loop and correctly state the values of variables in each iteration.\n",
    "- Write for loops that use the Accumulator pattern to aggregate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points:\n",
    "- A *for loop* executes commands once for each value in a collection.\n",
    "- A `for` loop is made up of a collection, a loop variable, and a body.\n",
    "- The first line of the `for` loop must end with a colon, and the body must be indented.\n",
    "- Indentation is always meaningful in Python.\n",
    "- Loop variables can be called anything, but it is best to use a meaningful name.\n",
    "- The body of a loop can contain many statements.\n",
    "- Use `range` to iterate over a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "- The Accumulator pattern turns many values into one.\n",

    "## A *for loop* executes commands once for each value in a collection.\n",
