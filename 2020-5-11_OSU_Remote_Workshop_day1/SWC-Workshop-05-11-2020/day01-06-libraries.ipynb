    "- How can I use software that other people have written?\n",
    "- How can I find out what that software does?\n",

    "## Objectives:\n",
    "- Explain what software libraries are and why programmers create and use them.\n",
    "- Write programs that import and use libraries from Python's standard library.\n",
    "- Find and read documentation for standard libraries interactively (in the interpreter) and online.\n",

    "- Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.\n",
    "- A program must import a library module in order to use it.\n",
    "- Use `help` to learn about the contents of a library module.\n",
    "- Import specific items from a library to shorten programs.\n",
